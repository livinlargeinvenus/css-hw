            <h2 class="text-40">ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS</h2>
            <p>Our hardware, software and digital services provide fully integrated solutions for musicians, producers
                and DJs across all genres and experience levels.</p>
            <p>KOMPLETE, the world's leading production suite, includes not only the sounds of a meticulously sampled
                Stradivari violin, but hard-hitting synths that have shaped modern techno. MASCHINE, an intuitive
                production and performance instrument, lets creators generate ideas on the fly, while TRAKTOR, our range
                of essential DJ equipment, makes four-deck mixing with pro precision possible. Each product is platform
                agnostic, and compatible with the full spectrum of music creation and performance tools.</p>
            <p>We're also advancing our vision for a more open creative ecosystem with KONTAKT, a powerful engine for
                creating and playing sampled sounds; and NKS, our integration technology that connects Native
                Instruments controllers to instruments and effects from hundreds of other leading developers. In
                addition to bringing a huge range of sounds, effects, loops and samples into one streamlined workflow,
                these platforms are helping hundreds of small businesses thrive – from composers building orchestral
                sample libraries to boutique modular synth builders.</p>
            <p>Our community of creators and audiophiles is one of the biggest in the world, and provides music makers
                with the help, feedback, inspiration and motivation they need to keep going. From workshops and
                tutorials to active online forums, we're committed to ensuring everyone feels supported along every step
                of their journey.</p>
